# Code of Conduct: _Short Synopsis_

## Key Principles 

This Code is precedent upon three key principles, from which all else follows. These are:

1. **Truth:** we are scientists, so we strive for honesty in research and interpersonal interactions.  
2. **Respect:** we recognize that we all deserve respect, so we strive to give it.
3. **Inclusion:** we see the strength in diversity, and thus are committed to inclusion.

## Commitments & Challenges

We are committed to **act with integrity**, to **respect everyone we come into contact with**, to **include the full diversity of the group**, and to **reject discrimination and bigotry**. 

Our challenges include **remote, physically and mentally taxing conditions**, the potentially constant **close proximity to our crewmates**, the fluid and sometimes nonexistent **boundaries between work and personal time and space**, and the **previous histories we each bring** to the research endeavor. 

By honoring our commitments, together we can overcome these challenges. 


## Prohibited Conduct

We will not tolerate **any form of harassment** or **sexual misconduct**. There will be **no alcohol or other drugs permitted** during fieldwork, even when it would be legally permissible. Additionally, it’s prohibited to **obstruct or disrupt research**, to **possess or use a gun** or other weapon, to **physically abuse another person**, to **damage property**, or to **incite others to do any of these things**. 


## Important Policies

This list is _non-exhaustive_ but covers the most important parts. Please read the [full Code](https://github.com/werdnus/code-of-conduct/blob/master/Code-of-Conduct.md).

1. **Treat everyone with respect**, including respecting gender identity and expression.
2. Any human **subjects research must be approved** by an OHRP recognized Institutional Review Board (IRB). 
3. Respect **local laws**, and **treat fairly** everyone helping with the research, including with **fair compensation**. 
4. Communicate about the project **openly and honestly**. 
5. Sexual misconduct and sexual/gender-based harassment will be dealt with in a way that is **victim-directed**, focused on **offender behavior**, and ensures **fair process**. 
6. **New relationships are prohibited** during the course of fieldwork to avoid conflicts of interest. 
7. Conflicts of interest, including **existing intimate relationships**, must be disclosed ahead of time.
8. If a violation is reported, **only the person with authority/power** is subject to punishment.


## Reporting Violations 

Because we are an inter-institutional group, there is not a clear governing body to deal with concerns. We address this by **designating two Ethics Officers**, who are responsible for fielding reports of potential violations, and making sure everyone understands this policy. **Any suspected violations of this policy should be reported to one of the Ethics Officers.** Additionally, we have an **Ethics Partner Institution**, whose policies and code of conduct we all agree to be bound by, where this Code doesn’t provide clear direction. Those are: 


   Ethics Officer: _____________________________________________________________________
   
   Ethics Officer: _____________________________________________________________________
   
   Ethics Partner Institution: _____________________________________________________________

Any type of **retaliation for reporting**, or participating in an investigation, is strictly forbidden. 


## Investigation Process

When a suspected violation has been reported, an investigation will take place. The victim in whatever situation is to be investigated, will be able to choose if they want an **internal** or **external** investigation. 

1. **Internal Investigations.** This is what happens when the victim wants to keep things internal to the research group. Project leadership or Ethics Officers will **attempt to determine the facts of the case** through interviews, maintain confidentiality, keep detailed notes, and write a report. The victim may decide **at any point in this process**, including after the investigation is completed, that they would rather have an External Investigation.
2. **External Investigation.** This involves a request that the Ethics Partner Institution get involved. An External Investigation means turning over all relevant documentation and authority to the Ethics Partner Institution’s Title IX office, and **proceeding with an investigation using the policies and procedures of that institution**. It is always possible for a victim to request transition from an Internal to an External investigation, but it may not be possible to go the other direction, depending on the policies of the Ethics Partner institution. 


## Outcomes and Sanctions

Outcomes of any investigation will be directed towards **supporting victims** and **preventing recurrence** of the issue. **Sanctions** can include everything from **official reprimand** up to and including **removal from the project** entirely and **prohibition from future collaboration**. 


## Agreement

Agreement to this Code of Conduct is a requirement for participating in the project. We all sign to indicate our agreement.

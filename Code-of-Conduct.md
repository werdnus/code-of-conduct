# Code of Conduct _for Inter-Institutional Fieldwork_

## Key Principles

We are a group of researchers united in our pursuit of knowledge, regardless of the particular discipline, training, or credentials that we each bring to this endeavor. Each of us will have an important part to play in the work to come. To aid in this work, **we must have a clear understanding of the boundaries between acceptable and unacceptable conduct.** This document, the Code of Conduct for Inter-Institutional Fieldwork, is intended to provide such an understanding.

We are collectively committed to certain key principles, which will guide our conduct during shared and individual activities associated with this project. These principles are:

1. **Truth:** we are scientists and researchers, engaged in the creation and discovery of knowledge. Our commitment to truth, however, goes beyond our professional goals, and informs the way we interact with each other, fostering a culture of honesty and trust within the group.
2. **Respect:** we are a group of individuals, each with unique thoughts, needs, and desires. We are committed to treating each other with the respect that we know ourselves to deserve, providing due regard for the rights, emotions, and traditions of every member of the group.
3. **Inclusion:** as scientists, we recognize the beauty in diversity, and celebrate that diversity. We are a heterogeneous group, including different races, religions, ethnicities, genders, sexualities, and many other aspects. We are committed to the inclusion of all of the diversity among us, without discrimination or bias.

Our commitment to these key principles guides our adoption of this Code of Conduct for this shared endeavor that we have embarked upon. When it is unclear what course of action is best, we will reflect upon these key principles, and let them inform our judgment. Although this Code specifically addresses many ethics and conduct issues, it is not intended to cover all possible situations.

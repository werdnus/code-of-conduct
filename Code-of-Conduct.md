# Code of Conduct _for Inter-Institutional Fieldwork_

## Key Principles

We are a group of researchers united in our pursuit of knowledge, regardless of the particular discipline, training, or credentials that we each bring to this endeavor. Each of us will have an important part to play in the work to come. To aid in this work, **we must have a clear understanding of the boundaries between acceptable and unacceptable conduct.** This document, the Code of Conduct for Inter-Institutional Fieldwork, is intended to provide such an understanding.

We are collectively committed to certain key principles, which will guide our conduct during shared and individual activities associated with this project. These principles are:

1. **Truth:** we are scientists and researchers, engaged in the creation and discovery of knowledge. Our commitment to truth, however, goes beyond our professional goals, and informs the way we interact with each other, fostering a culture of honesty and trust within the group.
2. **Respect:** we are a group of individuals, each with unique thoughts, needs, and desires. We are committed to treating each other with the respect that we know ourselves to deserve, providing due regard for the rights, emotions, and traditions of every member of the group.
3. **Inclusion:** as scientists, we recognize the beauty in diversity, and celebrate that diversity. We are a heterogeneous group, including different races, religions, ethnicities, genders, sexualities, and many other aspects. We are committed to the inclusion of all of the diversity among us, without discrimination or bias.

Our commitment to these key principles guides our adoption of this Code of Conduct for this shared endeavor that we have embarked upon. When it is unclear what course of action is best, we will reflect upon these key principles, and let them inform our judgment. Although this Code specifically addresses many ethics and conduct issues, it is not intended to cover all possible situations. 



## Commitments 

Following from the Key Principles that each of us will attempt to embody throughout our work together, we acknowledge the following **priorities and commitments**, for the project upon which this group of researchers is about to embark. We will:



*   Approach personal and professional interactions with honesty and integrity;
*   Practice personal and academic integrity and expect it from others;
*   Promote a culture of respect, respecting the dignity and essential worth of all individuals, including their privacy, property, and freedom;
*   Reject bigotry, discrimination, violence, or intimidation of any kind;
*   Not tolerate sexual and gender-based harassment and violence of any kind;
*   Promote the diversity of opinions, ideas, and backgrounds which is the lifeblood of the research community;
*   Completely avoid discrimination, favoritism, abuse of professional authority, and bribery in any form; 
*   Avoid conflicts of interest, real or perceived, and disclose unavoidable conflicts.

These priorities and commitments form the basis of sound working relationships between us. We recognize that this is not an exhaustive list, but is intended to provide an ethical framework with which to approach our professional and personal interactions throughout the time that we are engaged in this project together.


## Challenges

We acknowledge the following unique challenges presented by this Inter-Institutional Fieldwork project, which we are about to undertake:

*   Remote and physically taxing field conditions;
*   Physically close working and living conditions;
*   Porous and organic boundaries between work and personal time;
*   Porous and organic boundaries between work and personal spaces;
*   Previous work and personal histories among persons who are undertaking this project. 

We acknowledge these challenges at the forefront of our shared fieldwork endeavor, in the hope that foreknowledge engenders preparation. Our key principles — truth, respect, and inclusion, and all that follows from them — are all the more important in the context of these challenges. By acknowledging these challenges, we reaffirm the above commitments, and endeavor to prepare to meet those commitments even under the most challenging of circumstances.


## Prohibited Conduct

The field portion of the project which we are about to undertake will require unusual care in our personal interactions. Unfortunately, as members of this expedition we are not free to behave entirely as we might in a personal living situation. To protect all members of our expedition, for the duration of the project, not only work-time and work-spaces must be regulated, but also after-hours personal time and spaces. 

To that end, **we will not tolerate any form of harassment or sexual misconduct**. Because every person’s relationship with drugs and alcohol is different, and some are better at managing that relationship than others, **there will be no alcohol or other drugs permitted during fieldwork** or the course of other project activities, even in cases where it would be legally permissible. In the intensive field conditions under which we will be operating during this project, the following behaviors are completely inappropriate:

*   Sexual misconduct of any kind;
*   Sexual or gender-based harassment of any kind;
*   Discriminatory harassment of any kind;
*   Use, possession, or distribution of alcohol or illegal drugs at research sites or other sites where project activities take place;
*   Obstruction or disruption of research, teaching, administration, or other project activities;
*   Possession or use of firearms, explosives, or other dangerous weapons at research sites or other sites where project activities take place;
*   Detention or physical abuse of any person or conduct intended to threaten imminent bodily harm or endanger the health of any person at research sites or other sites where project activities take place;
*   Malicious damage, misuse, or theft of project property, or the property of others;
*   Inciting others to engage in any of the conduct or to perform any of the acts prohibited herein.


## Specific sections 

### Definitions

We offer the following definitions, to make clear some of the boundaries that will be necessary to maintain during this project:

   **Workplace:** For the duration of fieldwork, the workplace includes all shared spaces, environments, and infrastructure, including but not limited to kitchens, sleeping quarters, common areas, laboratories, field research sites, trails and walkways, and any other location where it might reasonably be expected that a members of the crew could interact with one another. 

   **Personal space:** Any location where a crew member can reasonably be said to have ownership of that space, such as personal tents or bedrooms. It should be noted that in many instances of remote field work, crew members may not have access to personal space (e.g., when bedrooms are shared, that space cannot be reasonably said to be owned by only one crew member, and is thus considered part of the workplace). 

   **Working relationship:** During fieldwork, much as all shared spaces are considered part of the workplace, all relationships with other crew members, field assistants and guides, field station staff, and other people working to aid the research endeavor, should explicitly be considered working relationships. In the close confines of fieldwork, it is impossible to have a relationship that is purely personal, because each crew member is representing the project at all times. This should be kept in mind: even interactions that happen late in the evening, when no work activities are happening, are interactions between co-workers, and should be treated as such, with all due consideration and respect. 

   For **sexual misconduct**, **sexual and gender-based harassment**, and **discriminatory harassment**, see the below (_Sexual Misconduct & Sexual/Gender-based Harassment_). 


### Research Ethics in the Field

Following from our key principles, we will approach our research with ethics and integrity. We will carefully consider the impacts of our research, both immediate and long-term, on the sites, organisms, and peoples involved, directly or tangentially. It is paramount to consider the implications and motivations of our research, and to craft our study designs in ways that minimize harm, be it to particular people or the global community. This is a particularly grave concern for research involving **human subjects**. Here, we commit to certain best practices for engaging in field research: 

1. **IRB Approval.** Any research with human subjects must reflect a thoughtful and culturally appropriate consideration of the effects of the inquiry on the participants, and should, in general, include a clear process for obtaining informed consent from participants. To that end, **all human subjects research must be approved by an Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) accredited Institutional Review Board (IRB)**. If it is unclear which institution’s IRB has authority over approving the human subjects research, the project should pursue approval through the Ethics Partner Institution (see below, Re_porting Potential Violations & Addressing Concerns_). This policy does not replace or supersede the policies of whatever home institution the human subjects research originates at, but complements such policies. 
2. **Local Laws.** It should also be noted that countries or localities in which human subjects research is carried out may have particular permitting and ethical regulations. We are committed to respectful treatment of our hosts, both locally and nationally, while engaged in fieldwork, and this includes **honoring local laws and customs with respect to research norms and practices.** This may include things like required permits that are not standard in our own countries (e.g., sample mobilization permits, or export permits), deposition of samples or sample duplicates in local natural history or medical collections, and many other things. It is our responsibility to determine the requirements of research in a particular location before we undertake such research. 
3. **Fair Treatment.** Often, in isolated field settings we are working with field guides, parabiologists, or other local people helping to ensure that our research is a success, such as cooks, housekeepers, muleskinners, porters, and other skilled and unskilled laborers. We acknowledge that **we would not be able to engage in research without such help**, and are thus committed to fair treatment of people involved in our research, regardless of their status as group members. Fair treatment involves fair compensation, appropriate to local norms, for services provided. We will allocate project resources in a way that prevents the frequent dynamic of research as an extractionist activity, moving knowledge and other resources from developing to developed countries. Additionally, we are committed to ensuring that the products of our research are available to those closest to that research. 
4. **Conflicts of Interest.** Should any conflicts of interest arise, **the interests of the communities within which the research takes place will take precedence over all other considerations,** including the success of the project. This is particularly important to consider in cases where research involves human subjects. If the study has negative repercussions for any members of the target culture, the project cannot be considered a success. We must do everything in our power to protect the dignity and privacy of the people with whom we conduct this field study.
5. **Honest Representation.** We will **not misrepresent the work of others as our own work**, either in speaking or writing. We will give full credit to all those who have contributed to our work.

Extra care must be taken with human subjects research. In such cases we will ensure that: 

1. The right of those providing information to researchers either **to remain anonymous or to receive recognition** is to be respected and defended. It is our responsibility to make every effort to determine the preferences of those providing information and to comply with their wishes. It should be made clear to anyone providing information that despite our best intentions and efforts, anonymity may be compromised or recognition may fail to materialize. Additionally, we should strive never to reveal the identity of groups or persons whose anonymity is protected through the use of pseudonyms, either accidentally or purposefully.
2. We are candid from the outset in the communities where we work about the nature of our research, our identities, and our goals. The **aims of our study project should be clearly communicated to those among whom we work** at the onset of research. We must acknowledge the help and services we receive, and we must recognize our obligation to reciprocate in culturally appropriate ways. We will take into account and, where relevant and to the best of our ability, make explicit the extent to which our own personal and cultural values affect the project. We have an obligation to assess both the positive and negative consequences of our field work. We will do our best to anticipate any possible consequences, and to inform individuals and groups likely to be affected. 


### Gender-Identity and Expression

Respect for the human diversity that makes up our group, and the people with whom we work, follows clearly from our key principles — truth, respect, and inclusion. **We will treat all people with respect**, regardless of their race, religion, culture, neurological diversity, disability, sex, gender, sexuality, gender expression or identity, or any other differentiating characteristic of identity, history, or genetics. All people are _people_, first and foremost, and deserving of the same respect with which we hope to be treated. 

We recognize that we are all products of our lived experience, and as such that we each carry with us [implicit biases](http://faculty.washington.edu/agg/pdf/Gwald%26Krieger.CLR.2006.pdf), the unconscious attribution of particular qualities to members of a certain group (Greenwald & Krieger 2006). We are committed to conscious effort to counter our implicit biases, and to not allow such biases to impact our professional and personal relationships in this group. We will take feedback in this regard with open minds and hearts, recognizing that any feedback is a reflection of compassion and respect: being given the opportunity to alter one’s actions and ideas is an invitation, not an attack. 

Given the above, we provide these guiding principles and policies to help everyone in the group treat each other with the respect for the diversity of the group that is deserved: 

1. **Privacy.** All group members have the right to discuss any aspect of their identity openly, or to keep that information private. In particular, transgender and gender-nonconforming group members’ gender identity or expression are theirs to discuss, or not, at their choosing. Each member of the group gets to decide when, with whom, and how much to share their private information. Information about a person’s transgender status (such as the sex they were assigned at birth) can constitute confidential medical information under privacy laws like HIPAA.

    Project leadership and all crew members with formal or informal authority should _not_ disclose information that may reveal a crew member’s personal information (including transgender status or gender non-conforming presentation) to others. That kind of personal or confidential information may only be shared with the crew member in question’s consent.

2. **Names & Pronouns.** Every crew member has the right to be addressed by the name and pronoun that correspond to their gender identity, upon request. A court-ordered name or gender change is_ not_ required. The intentional or persistent refusal to respect any crew member’s gender identity (for example, intentionally referring to someone by a name or pronoun that does not correspond to that person’s gender identity) can constitute harassment and is a violation of this policy. If you are unsure what pronoun a transitioning or gender non-conforming crew member might prefer, you can politely ask how they would like to be addressed. We recommend attempting to cultivate gender-neutral language (e.g., singular _they_), using a person’s name in place of pronouns if you are unsure and cannot ask, and practicing regularly with pronouns you struggle to remember, to avoid mistakes and encourage respect between all group members.
3. **Sex-segregated Facilities & Activities.** For sex-segregated tasks and the use of sex-segregated facilities, transgender crew members will be classified and assigned in a manner **consistent with their gender identity**, not their sex assigned at birth. 

    Crew members shall have access to the restroom corresponding to their gender identity. Any crew member who has a need or desire for increased privacy, regardless of the underlying reason, will be provided access to a single-stall restroom, when available; no crew member, however, shall be required to use such a restroom. All crew members have a right to safe and appropriate restroom facilities, including the right to use a restroom that corresponds to the crew member’s gender identity, regardless of the crew member’s sex assigned at birth. That is, transgender women must be permitted to use the women’s restroom, and transgender men must be permitted to use the men’s restroom. 

    The decision of how to sort into sex-segregated spaces and activities should be left to the transgender or gender non-conforming crew member to determine the most appropriate and safest option for them. Their decision will be respected by the project leadership, and the entire crew. 

**Discrimination/Harassment.** We will not tolerate any form of discrimination or harassment (including sexual harassment) based on gender identity or expression. Such conduct is a violation of this Code; any incident of discrimination, harassment, or violence based on gender identity or expression will be given immediate and effective attention (see below, [**Sexual Misconduct & Sexual/Gender-based Harassment**](https://github.com/werdnus/code-of-conduct/blob/readme-edits/Code-of-Conduct.md#sexual-misconduct--sexualgender-based-harassment)). 


### Sexual Misconduct & Sexual/Gender-based Harassment

**Sexual misconduct and sexual/gender-based harassment and violence, as well as all forms of discriminatory harassment, are strictly prohibited. We recognize that these behaviors are contrary to our core principles of truth, respect, and inclusion, and detrimental to the research endeavor we are collectively engaged in. These behaviors will not be tolerated.**

We are committed to fostering a research and field experience that is free of all forms of abuse, assault, harassment, and coercive conduct, including sexual misconduct. As such, we do not tolerate sexual misconduct by group members in any form whatsoever. We have a responsibility to enact, improve, and enforce efforts to **prevent** sexual misconduct, to **support** victims should it occur, and to obtain appropriate **resolution** in order to keep it from recurring.

In cases where there is suspected or alleged sexual misconduct of any form, we are committed to a process that is **victim-directed**. Sexual and gender-based harassment and violence, no matter the form it takes, is an alienating experience for the victim, and often removes their sense of agency and control of their environment and choices. We seek to counter this by giving as much control as possible back to victims at each step of the process. We will do everything in our power to provide access to reasonable resources, including advocacy, medical treatment, emotional support, assistance with impacted research tasks, and aid in initiation of any desired legal proceedings, such as arbitration or restraining orders. We will also provide clear and complete explanations of options, decisions, and actions. 

We recognize that regardless of circumstances (including use of drugs/alcohol, previous relationships, style of dress, and sexual history), there is no excuse for non-consensual sexual activity. As such, all investigations and resolutions of sexual misconduct instances will be **focused on offender behavior** in relation to clear definitions of prohibited conduct.

We are committed to **a fair process** in all investigations and resolutions related to sexual misconduct in all of its myriad forms. Clearly defined prohibited conduct relating to sexual misconduct—in all its forms—will serve as the basis for all determinations of responsibility and appropriate sanctions.

**_Sexual harassment_** is defined as:

   Any sexual advance, any request for sexual favors, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature, when: 

>a. submission to such advances, requests, or conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual’s continuation with the project or evaluation of their performance within the project, including but not limited to employment or academic experience; or 
   
>b. submission to or rejection of such advances, requests, or conduct by an individual is used as a basis or condition for employment or academic decisions affecting such individual, including continuation with the project or evaluation of their performance within the project; or 

>c. such conduct is unwelcome and sufficiently severe or pervasive that it interferes with work or academic performance because it has created an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working or academic environment for the individual who is the object of such conduct. 

>d. Sexual harassment includes sexual misconduct (_see below_), sex and gender-based stalking, sex and gender-based harassment and bullying, dating violence, and domestic violence. Sexual harassment may be committed by any person upon any other person, regardless of the sex, gender, sexual orientation, and/or gender identity of those involved. In addition to sexual misconduct, as defined in the Student Conduct Code, sexual harassment is defined as follows:

**_Sexual misconduct_** is defined as: 


    Any single or repeated episode of (a) nonconsensual personal contact, (b) unwanted penetration, or (c) unwelcome sexual advance. Any single episode of any of these behaviors can be sufficient for a finding of sexual misconduct. Those behaviors are, specifically: 



1. Nonconsensual personal contact occurs when a person subjects another person to contact of a sexual nature when a reasonable person would know that such contact would cause emotional distress:
    1. Without having first obtained Explicit Consent; or
    2. When he or she knows or should have known the person was incapable of explicit consent by reason of Mental Disorder, Mental Incapacitation, or Physical Helplessness.
2. Unwanted Penetration is Penetration of another person, or causing the Penetration of another person, when one:
    3. Does not first obtain Explicit Consent from that person; or
    4. Knows or should have known the person was incapable of explicit consent by reason of Mental Disorder, Mental Incapacitation, or Physical Helplessness.
3. Sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature that is unwelcome and sufficiently severe or pervasive that interferes with work or access to educational benefits and opportunities because it has created an intimidating, hostile, or degrading environment and would have such an effect on a reasonable person.

**Discriminatory harassment** is defined as:


    This is conduct that unreasonably discriminates among individuals on the basis of race, color, sex, gender, national origin, age, religion, marital status, disability, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression, and that is sufficiently severe or pervasive that it interferes with work or academic performance. Discriminatory harassment includes, but is not limited to: 



1. Racial harassment, which is conduct that disparages, ridicules, or is physically abusive of a person based on that person’s race; 
2. Gender-based harassment, which is conduct that disparages, ridicules, or is physically abusive of a person based on that person’s sex, gender, gender identity, gender presentation, or gender expression;
3. Sexual harassment, defined above.

See below (sections _Reporting Potential Violations_ and _Addressing Concerns_) for guidelines on appropriate action if you believe that you or someone else in the group is the victim of sexual misconduct or sexual/gender-based harassment. Any crew member making good faith reports under this policy, or participating in investigation (internal or external) initiated under this policy, will be protected from retaliation for such reporting or participation.


### Conflicts of Interest and Abuses of Power

Sexual, physically intimate, or romantic relationships have the potential to create conflicts of interest within the community of researchers involved in this project. This includes domestic partners and spouses, and other forms of pre-existing sexual or intimate relationships. Such relationships can create conflicts of interest in the context of the project when one individual has, or could reasonably expect to have, responsibility for supervising, directing, overseeing, evaluating, advising, or influencing the actions or educational status of the other. 

	We are interested in creating a research environment marked by professional behavior, mutual respect, and fair treatment for all project participants. As such, we are concerned with the possible conflicts of interest that may result from intimate relationships, because such **conflicts of interest may lead to serious abuses of power, coercion, exploitation, favoritism, or unfair treatment of others**. Any relationship where one individual has power over the other has the potential to seriously affect morale and lead to an intolerable research environment. Further, even a romantic relationship that begins in a consensual way may become uncomfortable or nonconsensual, leading to sexual harassment or sexual misconduct. 

Given these issues with conflicts of interest arising from intimate relationships, we agree that: 



1. **No crew member will solicit, initiate or enter into a sexual, physically intimate, or romantic relationship with any other crew member during the course of fieldwork and associated project activities.** 

    We recognize that this is an especially strict prohibition, and we agree to it with the understanding that the research endeavor we are about to undertake will bring us into extreme conditions, of both physical hardship and close physical proximity, and that we will all need clear heads and professional conduct for this to be a successful research experience. We also agree to it recognizing the largely undiscussed history of fieldwork as a time when normal institutional rules and standards are relaxed or absent, which has led to a great deal of problematic relationships, nonconsensual sexual encounters, and undocumented harassment, particularly of female students and technicians. We are committed to changing that dynamic in our own fieldwork.


    Any relationship can take unexpected turns, but those that develop under the particular combination of isolation, physical and mental stress, and close proximity that result from fieldwork may be particularly likely to end uncomfortably. We recognize that in the close confines of fieldwork, it is often impossible to take space away from people, a frequent need for people coming out of an intimate relationship, even a short-lived one. Additionally, we acknowledge that under the particular conditions of fieldwork, where group members are isolated together for days to months, it can often be difficult to judge consent clearly, because decision-making may be altered by the particular social and physical conditions of fieldwork. These factors all lead us to accept the prohibition on new intimate relationships. 

2. **Pre-existing relationships** **must be disclosed by the crew members to the project leadership**, before the start of fieldwork, so that appropriate arrangements can be made. Pre-existing relationships are intimate or romantic relationships that exist between crew members prior to the start of fieldwork and associated project activities. Appropriate arrangements are actions reasonably calculated to remove or mitigate known or potential conflicts of interest or abuses of power, taking into account the interests of the project, the parties in the relationship, and other crew members actually or potentially affected.
3. **Any suspected violations of this policy should be reported to the Ethics Officers** (see below, _Reporting Potential Violations_). Only the crew member with instructional, evaluative, formal advisory, supervisory, or other hierarchical authority or power is subject to sanction for violation of this policy. Any crew member making good faith reports under this policy, or participating in investigation (internal or external) initiated under this policy, will be protected from retaliation for such reporting or participation. 

We expect all crew members to treat all other crew members with decorum and respect, regardless of pre-existing relationships and potential conflicts of interest. We recognize that, in the close confines and physically, mentally, and emotionally taxing environment of remote fieldwork, even the best of relationships may be strained. In the event of pre-existing relationships, Ethics Officers (see below) and project leadership will check in with all members of the relationship regularly, and determine if additional appropriate arrangements are necessary to avoid or mitigate any adverse effects such pre-existing relationships may have on moral, project success, and personal well-being of all involved.


### Reporting Potential Violations & Addressing Concerns

Any crew member making good faith reports under this Code of Conduct, or participating in investigation (internal or external) initiated under this policy, will be protected from retaliation for such reporting or participation.



1. Designation of Ethics Officers

    The leadership of the group will **designate at least two people in the group as Ethics Officers** for the duration of the fieldwork and the project, and **ensure that everyone in the group is aware of who the Ethics Officers are**. Any suspected violations should be reported to one of these two people, who are the point people for reporting. 


    The Ethics Officers should, ideally, be (a) from different institutions and (b) working on different aspects of the project. We recognize that it is unlikely that any group of field researchers will be able to identify two members of the group which have no overlap in spheres of influence, research communities, or circles of friendships. The two suggestions above are to ensure as little overlap as possible between the two (or more) Ethics Officers with respect to those with whom they have close relationships, either working or personal. Grant leadership should endeavor to designate Ethics Officers that will allow for anyone experiencing an ethical issue, such as sexual misconduct, to go to a person unconnected with the perpetrator. 


    Ethics Officers: ________________________________________________________________


    _____________________________________________________________________________

1. Designation of Ethics Partner Institution

    The project leadership, in coordination with the designated Ethics Officers, will determine one of the participating institutions to be the project’s Ethics Partner Institution. **All members of the project agree that the code of conduct and ethics-related policies of this institution will apply to all group members**. This includes governance and conduct of investigations, Title IX reporting actions, and all other aspects of ethics and conduct related policy. By designating an Ethics Partner Institution, we have the ability to clearly resolve complaints and allegations under a single unified set of policies. We also have the ability to draw upon the institutional infrastructure for unbiased investigation of ethics related complaints. 


    We do, however, recognize that the disciplinary policies of the Ethics Partner Institution will be difficult to apply in cases where group members belong to different institutions. We will work closely with all institutions involved to share findings from any investigations with relevant institutions, and ensure fair treatment of all, including appropriate consequences for offenders and protections for victims, regardless of their institutional homes.


    Ethics Partner Institution: _________________________________________________________ 

2. Retaliation

    **We prohibit retaliation against any individual who reports potential violations of this Code**, or the code of conduct or policies of the Ethics Partner Institution, or who participates in an investigation (either internal, external, or criminal) of such reports. Any attempt by a member of the group to intimidate, penalize, or threaten a person who reports or who is otherwise involved or cooperating in the investigation of a report of a potential violation is strictly prohibited. Any person found to have participated in an act of retaliation will be disciplined accordingly. 

3. Investigation Process

    Ethics Officers will report any instances of misconduct to the project leadership, unless the project leadership is involved in the complaint. Project leadership, in collaboration with the Ethics Officers, will initiate an investigation of the complaint, which begins with a conversation with the person bringing forward the complaint. As stated above, we are committed to a **victim-directed process**, which means honoring the desires of the victim. 


    The victim will have the choice of requesting an **internal** or **external** investigation. This is important, because there are both factors that lead victims of misconduct to desire reduced exposure and more ‘informal’ processes, and factors that lead such victims to desire more distant, impartial judgement of their situations, and the balance of these factors will be unique in each case. It is important for the victim to retain control of their process. 

1. **Internal Investigations** will be led by project leadership, or in cases where the project leadership is involved in the complaint, by the Ethics Officers. The leader of the investigation will attempt to determine the facts of the case through interviews with relevant parties, including members of the crew and staff of any facilities in use. The investigator will (1) maintain strict confidentiality during the investigation, (2) keep detailed, contemporaneous notes of all investigation steps, and (3) prepare a written report of findings after investigation is completed. Internal investigations will be completed in a timely manner. Report and contemporaneous notes will be submitted to the project leadership, unless they are involved in the complaint. See below for possible actions that may result from findings of such an investigation. 

        The victim may decide at any point in this process, up to and including after it is completed and the report has been prepared, that they would rather ask for an External Investigation. 

2. **External Investigations** will be undertaken in accordance with the policies and practices of the Ethics Partner Institution. Every effort will be made by the project leadership and Ethics Officers to maintain a victim-directed process, but the amount of control that the victim will have on the process will depend upon the policies of the Ethics Partner Institution. 

        Whether or not the victim can decide to cancel the external investigation in favor of an internal investigation will depend upon the policies of the Ethics Partner Institution. The Ethics Officers and project leadership should be sure to determine these policies at the time of selection of the Ethics Partner Institution. 


    Following from our core principles, any and all investigation procedures will strive to accomplish the following:

*   The victim is shepherded through the process by Ethics Officers and project leadership who understand the procedures and “next steps” at each phase of the process;
*   The victim is given as much control over timing and how to proceed through the process as possible;
*   Victims are not re-traumatized — this includes ensuring that victims are not required to restate their story multiple times to multiple people; are not required to come face-to-face with the accused crew member; are not questioned directly by the accused crew member; and do not have their past sexual history considered by the Ethics Officer, project leadership, the authorities of the Ethics Partner Institution, etc.;
*   The process is completed in a timely manner so that the victim does not have to “re-live” the trauma of the event for a prolonged period of time;
*   The accused crew member may be removed or suspended during the course of investigation, either internal or external, if there is any evidence that the crew member is a continuing threat to the victim and/or other members of the crew;
4. Outcomes and Sanctions 

    Outcomes from any conduct investigation should be focused on **supporting victims** and **preventing recurrence** of whatever the conduct issue was. Disciplinary sanctions are a useful tool towards these goals, and will be applied in a manner that prevents further misconduct, protects victims from re-traumatization, and is fair and appropriate to the findings of the investigation.


    We recognize that, as an inter-institutional group of researchers, our authority to impose academic and professional sanctions is limited. Given these circumstances, however, we will administer outcomes and sanctions resulting from conduct investigations such that:

1. All sanctions and outcomes are administered in a manner that is fair and appropriate to the findings of the investigations;
2. When appropriate, sanctions may include, but not be limited to: 
    1. Official reprimand; 
    2. Demotion in author lists and other forms of professional recognition for participation in the project;
    3. Creation of channels of communication and collaboration that allow for professional isolation between victim and perpetrator; 
    4. Orders of no contact between victim and perpetrator; 
    5. Removal from project leadership position or other position of authority within the project; 
    6. Removal from the project entirely;
    7. Prohibition from future collaboration with other project participants, for durations up to and including life.
3. Any crew member found to be responsible for attempted or completed sexual misconduct will have a comprehensive report of the incident sent to their home institution and supervisor, and all efforts will be made to ensure that this report is available to all relevant parties, including potential employers and transfer institutions. It will, however, be up to the home institution if additional disciplinary sanctions will be applied outside of the context of the project. 
4. Additionally, any recommendation or reference from the project leadership for participants found to be responsible for attempted or completed sexual misconduct will be accompanied by this report. 
5. Where the sanctions and consequences imposed by the project leadership does not satisfy the victim, the project leadership will make every effort to help the victim seek outside recourse and locate a channel for their complaints with the ability to help find a path forward for the victim, including initiation of external investigation through the Ethics Partner Institution, outside mediation or arbitration, and/or the initiation of legal proceeding.
